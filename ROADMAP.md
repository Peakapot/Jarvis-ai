# Roadmap

This roadmap describes the planned evolution of Jarvis. It is intentionally
incremental: each phase builds on a stable foundation so that **no major
architectural refactoring is required** to reach the next. Dates are indicative;
priorities may shift.

## Guiding themes

- Keep every component **replaceable** and **configuration-driven**.
- Prefer adding **modules** over modifying the core.
- Maintain **recoverability, observability and security** as first-class
  concerns at every phase.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation ✅ (v0.1.0)

- Idempotent installer, validation/health/status/diagnostics framework.
- Docker-first topology (n8n + Ollama; future services behind profiles).
- Provider abstraction (AI/email/image).
- Workflows-as-source-code with full lifecycle tooling.
- Prompt management, backup/recovery, structured logging.
- Plugin module architecture (scaffolds).
- Enterprise documentation.

## Phase 1 — Core assistants hardening (next)

- Production-ready Telegram command set (`/help`, `/status`, `/research`,
  `/emails`, `/image`, `/cyber`) with rich responses and rate limiting.
- Cyber Brief: real PDF rendering pipeline, historical archive browser,
  expanded UAE/Gulf source set.
- Email assistant: inbox summaries, draft replies, categorisation &
  prioritisation wired end-to-end across Gmail/M365/SMTP.
- Credential validation surfaced in the readiness report.

## Phase 2 — Knowledge & memory

- Enable the Qdrant vector database (`vectordb` profile).
- `knowledge-assistant` module: document ingestion, RAG retrieval, research
  archives.
- Long-term memory and conversation history storage.
- Document storage abstraction.

## Phase 3 — Observability & operations

- Enable Prometheus/Grafana (`monitoring` profile) with dashboards for service
  health, workflow success/failure and resource usage.
- Alerting integrations (Telegram/email) for SLO breaches.
- Automated backup scheduling and restore drills.

## Phase 4 — Module expansion

- Promote scaffolded modules to GA as demand dictates:
  `meeting-assistant`, `calendar-assistant`, `iso27001-assistant`,
  `mindhaven-assistant`, `dealforge-assistant`, `presentation-assistant`,
  `image-assistant`.
- Module marketplace / discovery improvements.

## Phase 5 — Multi-user & scale

- Optional external Postgres for n8n; queue-mode execution.
- Per-user access control and quotas.
- Horizontal scaling guidance for stateless components.

Have an idea or need? Open a discussion or issue (see
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)). Proposals that add capabilities as
**modules** and preserve the architectural principles are especially welcome.
